So this is my new blog. I am using Hugo and host it on GitHub with GitHub pages. I really got to say it is really easy so host it. Simply create a repository with the name "username.github.io" and push your html to the master branch. That was it and you are done!

You have now a website "username.github.io" and can use your website.

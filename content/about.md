Hi!

My name is Christian Onuk and I'm from Austria. 

In this blog I write about all things that I work on and try out that have to do with Programming, IT and computers.

I'm interested in the following programming languages: Javascript, Typescript, Golang and C#.

So have fun on my blog and I hope you find something interesting for you!
